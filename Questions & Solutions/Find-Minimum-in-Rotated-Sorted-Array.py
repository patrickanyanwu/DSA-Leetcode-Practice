"""We start our minimum at the first value in the array incase it is sorted.
Use binary search but if value at m is greater than or equal to value on the far left we put l = m + 1 to look at the lower values that havenâ€™t been pivoted as pivoted values are on the left,
if not we put r = m â€“ 1, if at any point the number at l is less than the number at r (the window is sorted) we return that number."""
