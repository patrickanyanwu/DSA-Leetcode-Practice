""" We start left and right pointer at the beginning of the string, we initialize a set to hold characters within the window (the substring). 
If the character at index r is not in the set we add it to the set and increment r by 1, if the character at r is in the set (a duplicate) we remove the character at l from the set and increment l by 1 to find a new substring.
We then calculate the length as r â€“ l + 1 and keep track of max. 
O(n) time O(m) space, m being longest substring."""
