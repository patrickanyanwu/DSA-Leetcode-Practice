"""Use the enumerate function to put each number in the array into a HashMap with the key being the number and the value being its index.
Then for every number in the input array, I check if the target â€“ number is in the set and the index of target - number is not equal to the index of the current number,
if these statements are true then return both indexes. O(n) time O(n) space"""
