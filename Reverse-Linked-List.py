"""We set a before pointer equal to none, set a temp variable equal to the lists head and a after variable also equal to the lists head.
Now our loop runs while we have an after node, we set after = to its next,
set tempâ€™s next = to the before node then we update before by moving it to temp and we set temp equal to after In order to move temp over to the next node and continue our loop. """
